			"serviceGuideDesc":"In the process of using LED displays, have you ever encountered various issues and didn't know how to address them quickly? When determining the problems, it is essential to prioritize the main issues before the secondary ones, addressing the obvious and severe ones first and dealing with minor issues later. (Short circuits should take priority).",

				"title": "Resistor Testing Method",
				"content": "Set the multimeter to the resistance mode and measure the resistance value from a certain point on a normal circuit board to ground. Then, measure the same point on another identical circuit board to see if the resistance value differs from the normal value. If it's different, the problem area is determined."
			},
			"serviceGuide2": {
				"title": "Voltage Testing Method",
				"content": "Set the multimeter to the voltage mode and measure the voltage to ground from a specific point on the suspected problematic circuit. Compare it to the normal value. If it's not similar, the problem area is confirmed."
			},
			"serviceGuide3": {
				"title": "Short Circuit Testing Method",
				"content": "Set the multimeter to the short-circuit detection mode (some have a diode drop mode or a resistance mode, generally with an alarm function). Check if there is any short-circuit phenomenon. If a short circuit is found, it should be prioritized and resolved to prevent damage to other components. This method must be performed with the circuit powered off to avoid damaging the meter."
			},
			"serviceGuide4": {
				"title": "Voltage Drop Testing Method",
				"content": "Set the multimeter to the diode drop voltage testing mode. Since all ICs are composed of numerous basic unit components, only miniaturized, there will be a voltage drop on the pin when there is current passing through it. Generally, the voltage drop on the same pin of the same IC model is similar. You can assess the condition based on the voltage drop on the pins. This method must be performed with the circuit powered off. It has some limitations, for instance, it may not detect high-impedance devices."
